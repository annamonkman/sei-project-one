* JavaScript (ES6)
*	Git
*	GitHub

# Brief
The idea of Frogger is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.
The game must be playable for one player and the obstacles should be auto generated.
I wanted to give the game my own twist so chose to feature a snail instead of a frog, with the goal to help the snail get across a post-apocalyptic-esque wasteland with rats instead of cars and crisp packets and branches for the boards.  

# Approach Taken

### Day 1: Plan
Being new to JavaScript I wanted to keep my game simple and focus on meeting the brief requirements as well as I could. I started by wireframing the visuals and pseudo-coding the MVP. My MVP was to move one snail across the grid to the pipes at the end, with start game, restart game and lose functionality and collisions. I planned my time so that I would aim to reach the MVP after 5 days then have 2 days remaining for bugs and styling.
